`scalajs-java-time` is a BSD-licensed reimplementation of the `java.time` API
of JDK8 for Scala.js. It enables this API in Scala.js projects.

## Usage

Simply add the following line to your sbt settings:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-js" %%% "scalajs-java-time" % "1.0.0"
```

If you have a `crossProject`, the setting must be used only in the JS part:

```scala
lazy val myCross = crossProject
  ...
  .jsSettings(
    libraryDependencies += "org.scala-js" %%% "scalajs-java-time" % "1.0.0"
  )
```

**Requirement**: you must use a host JDK8 to *build* your project, i.e., to
launch sbt. `scalajs-java-time` does not work on earlier JDKs.

## Work in Progress / linking errors
